whiteboard-cli
==============

This is a command-line tool for tracking student grades in a hypothetical world where teachers use command-line tools for grading. It's unit tested to work as well as we thought it should.

Making this public because:
 - CS3500 has been completely restructured.
 - This was eating into my private repository limit.
 - It's 'decent' code.
 - I don't really care.
